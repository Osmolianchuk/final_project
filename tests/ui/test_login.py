"""
Automated UI Test for Web Form Submission Using Selenium

This script performs an automated user interface (UI) test specifically designed 
to validate the behavior of a web form located at https://demoqa.com/text-box.
The test automates the following steps:
1. Loads the webpage.
2. Verifies that the initial page load is complete.
3. Refreshes the page to ensure elements remain consistent through page reloads.
4. Waits until the desired input fields are fully loaded and visible.
5. Fills out the form fields with predetermined data.
6. Submits the form.
7. Verifies that the elements behave as expected after submission 
(optional if extended to implement).
8. Closes the browser to clean up resources.
